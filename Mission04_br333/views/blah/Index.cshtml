<h2>What I hope to get out of IS 413:</h2>
<p>
    This semester in IS 413 I hope to become comfortable programming at an enterprise level. I have a goal to understand everything that I am doing instead of merely
    doing something on an assignment because I am supposed to. I want to really learn C# and ASP.NET. I also want to strengthen my skills in programming logic since that
    has always been the most difficult part of programming for me. Lastly, I want to build my own confidence in my programming abilities so that I can confidently apply
    for jobs/internships in this field.

<h2>My Top #3 jobs:</h2>
<li>Data Analyst</li>
<li>Database Consultant</li>
<li>Project Management</li><br />
